# Motor Control

Have you ever had the chance to implement an agnostic Motor Control library?

Neither have I, and it sounds ridiculous but the idea of this repo is to have some kind of motor control that can be
used on a robot arm articulation or a mobile robot wheel. The main motors that I have at home are just Nema 14
steppers, an old Polulu 12V DC motor which power rating I forgot and some MG996R laying around from my college years.

## Features

I want this to be easy to port to any MCU I might use, I have an STM32F767zi Nucleo-144 board lying around as well and
it would be wonderful to be able to use such control on multiple boards. An architecture agnostic solution would yield
better results in the more modern architectures such as ARM or RISC-V.

## Bibliografy

Here I keep all the references for what I may find or do along development
