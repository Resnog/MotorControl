# Robot Articulation Control

This repo started as an exercise to make a motor control library, but in reality
all I wanted was to control robot articularions. Since its inception it has gone
through some design changes that will be addresses in due time. The purpose of
this repo is to give a set of tools that can be used on an MCU to control the
articulation and in some other CPU whose processing power is superior to any
MCU so that both can acheive motion control. This is not the motion control in
itself but the underlying tools to acheive it.


## Features

I want this to be easy to port to any MCU I might use, I have an STM32F767zi Nucleo-144 board lying around as well and
it would be wonderful to be able to use such control on multiple boards. An architecture agnostic solution would yield
better results in the more modern architectures such as ARM or RISC-V.

Here I keep all the references for what I may find or do along development
